### Affiliation
This project was developed as part of coursework for *CSE 512: Distributed Database Systems* at **Arizona State University (ASU)**.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
With the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technology, managing and analyzing the enormous volume of real-time data generated by these systems is a significant challenge. Autonomous vehicles interact with other vehicles, road infrastructure (e.g., sensors, traffic lights), and centralized control systems, necessitating an efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant database solution. Distributed databases like CockroachDB have become essential for managing large volumes of dynamic data across multiple nodes, ensuring consistency, availability, and fault tolerance. However, integrating these technologies into autonomous vehicle networks is still in its early stages, and existing systems often struggle with scalability, fault tolerance, and maintaining data integrity in real-time.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Managing real-time data such as vehicle locations, sensor inputs, traffic signals, and collision warnings in autonomous vehicle networks is critical for operational safety and efficiency. The challenges of scaling, fault tolerance, and consistency under real-time constraints can lead to operational risks, such as delays in collision detection or incorrect vehicle commands, compromising passenger safety. This project aims to design a distributed database system capable of handling the real-time data load in autonomous vehicle networks using CockroachDB.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Design and implement a scalable and fault-tolerant distributed database system using CockroachDB for autonomous vehicle networks.
- Ensure the system handles real-time data such as vehicle statuses, sensor readings, and traffic signals with high availability and fault tolerance.
- Implement techniques for data partitioning and replication to maintain system performance under heavy load.
- Demonstrate the consistency models prioritizing critical data (e.g., collision warnings) while allowing eventual consistency for less time-sensitive data.
- Evaluate the system’s performance in terms of latency, throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability under failure scenarios.
- Showcase real-time query processing capabilities, such as tracking vehicle proximity to a collision or adjusting routes based on traffic signals.

## 2. Features

1. *Geo-Partitioning*: Data is partitioned by geographic regions (North, South, East, West) to reduce latency and improve performance.
2. *Replication*:  
   - *Synchronous* for critical data (e.g., collision warnings, control commands).  
   - *Asynchronous* for less critical data (e.g., sensor readings).
3. *Real-Time Query Processing*:  
   - Find nearby vehicles to a collision site.  
   - Retrieve traffic signal status.  
   - Analyze vehicle routes and statuses.
4. *ACID-Compliant Transactions*: Ensures strong consistency for updates like collision warnings and control commands.
5. *Fault Tolerance*: Demonstrates automatic failover and recovery during node failures.

## 3. Project Setup

### Prerequisites 
1.⁠ ⁠Install *CockroachDB*:  
   - [Download CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/)  
   - Follow installation instructions for your operating system.  
2.⁠ ⁠Install a database client (optional):  
   - [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) for managing and visualizing the database.

### How to Start CockroachDB  

1. ⁠Start a single-node CockroachDB cluster:
   
   `cockroach start-single-node --insecure --listen-addr=localhost:26256`
   
2. Open the SQL shell:

   `bashcockroachsql--insecure--host=localhost:26257`

## 4. Evaluation Plan

### 4.1 Metrics for Evaluation
- **Response Time:** Measure the time to respond to real-time queries (e.g., vehicle status retrieval, collision warnings).
- **Throughput:** Track the number of vehicle updates, sensor inputs, and control commands processed per second.
- **Scalability:** Evaluate the system's performance with increasing vehicle and sensor data.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Simulate node failures and assess recovery time, data integrity, and system availability during failures.

### 4.2 Expected Outcomes
- A scalable, fault-tolerant distributed database system capable of handling real-time data in autonomous vehicle networks.
- Demonstration of geo-partitioning, multi-region replication, and real-time query processing.

## 5. Conclusion

This project aims to design and implement a distributed database system using CockroachDB to efficiently manage real-time data in autonomous vehicle networks. By addressing challenges like scalability, fault tolerance, and maintaining strong consistency, the system offers a robust solution for handling critical data in real-time. This project demonstrates the potential of modern distributed databases in managing high-availability systems in safety-critical domains like autonomous vehicles.
